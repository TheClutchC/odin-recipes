  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>I've always been trying to find new ways to use my sourdough starter, and now I've finally discovered the perfect combo.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>225 grams 90°F-95°F filtered water (32°C-35°C)</li>
        <li>15 grams salt</li>
        <li>250 grams ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration)</li>
        <li>250 grams type “00” flour</li>
        <li>125 grams high-protein bread flour</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the water and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the salt has completely dissolved. Add the ripe sourdough starter. Using your hands, pinch the starter into the water mixture until it is broken into small clumps throughout.</li>
        <li>Add the “00” flour and bread flour to the bowl. Using a Danish dough whisk or your hands, mix the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed, and no dry bits or lumps remain. The dough will be shaggy. Cover the bowl and rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured countertop and knead for 1 minute or so, or until the dough is mostly smooth. Lightly grease the mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough back into the bowl. Cover and proof at room temperature for about 3 hours. It should have risen about 50% and be smooth and rounded on the edges.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a clean countertop. Using a bench knife, divide the dough into three equal pieces (roughly 280 grams each).</li>
        <li>Shape the pizza dough pieces into balls. Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab the top portion of dough, stretch upwards, then fold back into the center. Repeat from the opposite edge. Continue along the outer edges of the dough, folding them back into the center to form a tightly seamed package.</li>
        <li>Flip the dough seam-side down and use your hands to gently shape into a round, using the countertop to build tension into the surface of the dough. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.
            <br>
            <br> Transfer the dough balls into a flour dusted proofing box (or rectangular pan with lid or large plate), setting them apart. Dust with flour. Cover and rest at room temperature for a minimum of 5 to 6 hours or until ready to assemble or bake pizza that evening. The dough will hold for 3 to 4 additional hours after proofing.</li>
    </ol>
